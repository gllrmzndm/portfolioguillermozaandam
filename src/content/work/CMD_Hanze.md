 [CMD Hanze Hogeschool](https://gllrmzndm.github.io/Hanzehogeschool/)

New website for myself, since I was too lazy to look up the building each time,
If you press "Where are the lesson buildings" you get to see pictures with lesson buildings.

If you press on one of the photos, Google Maps opens and you get directions automatically, everything is hardlinked.

- Everything in one place instead of scattered everywhere on the original Hanze website
- Darkmode and lightmode added

You can check out the website here: [CMD Hanzehogeschool](https://gllrmzndm.github.io/Hanzehogeschool/#)
